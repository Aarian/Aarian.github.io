Here, I have listed some of my works, based on their applications.  


   
## Time Series Analysis

* **Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR) using wave2vec.**  
   * **Main idea:** Using self supervised learning on huge amount of speech data for ASR task. **Tech: Python, speechbrain** 	 

* **Generative Language Model**  
   * **Main idea:** Here a transofmer based models used to learn the distribution of text data and finally genrate related data, as samples. **Tech: Python, speechbrain**
   
* **Machine Translation**  
   * **Main idea:** Using a seq2seq model using a GRU based Enc./ Dec Attentive model.**Tech: Python, speechbrain**  	 

* **Predicting Air pollution of Tehran province, based on the recorded time series, using random processes (GARCH / ARIMA(X) / SARIMA / ETS), and statistical tools. Tech: Python, Stats.model.**  
   * **Main idea:** Many time series are non-stationary, making it hard to follow and estimate their future values. In this work, random process mentioned above were used to tackle with some issues like trends, seasonality, volatility clustering, and etc. 	 

## Watermarking
* **Statistical Analysis of Contourlet Coefficients of Watermarked Images. Tech: Matlab**
   * **Main idea:** Designing an efficient statistical detector to classify the watermarked image from the clear one. The Generalized Gaussian as a prior for contourlet coefficient were employed, and ROC curve were used to evaluate the designed detector.
   
* **Injecting a text message into a 12 channels electrocardiogram signal based on pseudo random permutation. Tech: Matlab (B.Sc. Project)**   
   * **Main idea:** The key point relies on erratically, by a pseudo random permutation algorithm, change the channels order, without information loss.

## Image Denoising

* **Image Multiplicative Noise Removal Using Statistical Modeling In The Shearlet Domain. Tech: Matlab (M.Sc. Thesis)**
   * **Main idea:** Noise, and distortions, especially multiplicative noise, cause granular effects on images. The pivotal point of this work is to remove such effects by trasfering the image to the shearlet domain, and statistically model the the coeffcients to obtain an efficient estimator.
